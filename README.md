# Hello-World
Trial: Learning by yourself

## Introduction
Hi Humans!
**May** here. I am a boring PhD student in *Economics* who has passion for life. I pursue my doctoral degree at [HKU!](https://www.hku.hk/). 
I don't like coding at all but I have to master the skill which is required as necessary for a so-called "qualified" PhD candidate on the job market. That's why I am here. Honestly speaking, it is not out of **love** though,  please rest assured that I will commit to the learning process since I am **determined** and **persistent** once I have decided. Finally, I would like to share one of my favorite quotes with you from the acknowledged novel **The Shawshank Redemption**, which has been adapted to a well-known movie, that is:

> Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.
> - Stephen Edwin King
